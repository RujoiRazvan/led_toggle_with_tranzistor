## My first project with a transistor

If the button is pressed, the green light is turned on and in rest of time, the red led is turned on and the green led is off.

Components
* PushButton
* Green and Orange Led - 5mm
* 2x 1kOhm Resistor
* 1x 10kOhm Resistor
* BC337 - NPN Transistor
* Jumper cables
* 9V Battery
